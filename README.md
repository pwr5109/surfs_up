# Surfs Up

## Project Overview

This project aims to find out the temperature trends before opening a surf shop and to find out if a surf and ice-cream shop business is sustainable year round. 

The temperature data to be analyzed will be data from the months of June and December in Oahu.

## Results

Below is a table showing the Minimum, Maximum and Average temperatures for the months of June and December.

Theses values determine the profitability of opening a surf and ice-cream shop all year round.

| Statistics    | June Temperature | December Temperature |
| ------------- | ---------------- | -------------------- |
| Minimum Value | 64&deg;F         | 56&deg;F             |
| Maximum Value | 85&deg;F         | 83&deg;F             |
| Average Value | 74&deg;F         | 71&deg;F             |

## Summary

From the table above it can be seen that Average Temperatures observed for both months do not differ significantly. It would be safe to say that a Surf and Ice-Cream shop will be profitable all year round with just this information but then other factors apart from Temperature have to be taken into account.

The table below looks at the Precipitation for both months.

| Statistics    | June Precipitation | December Precipitation |
| ------------- | ------------------ | ---------------------- |
| Minimum Value | 0                  | 0                      |
| Maximum Value | 4.43               | 6.42                   |
| Average Value | 0.13               | 0.21                   |
