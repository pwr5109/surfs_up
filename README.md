## Results

Below is a table showing the Minimum, Maximum and Average temperatures for the months of June and December.

| Statistics    | June Temperature | December Temperature |
| ------------- | ---------------- | -------------------- |
| Minimum Value | 64&deg;F         | 56&deg;F             |
| Maximum Value | 85&deg;F         | 83&deg;F             |
| Average Value | 74&deg;F         | 71&deg;F             |
